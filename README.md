built a simple but functional TODO App as part of my backend development practice!🧠💻
✨ The app allows users to:
 👉 Sign up and sign in with JWT-based authentication
 👉 Create, update, and delete their TODOs
 👉 View their list of TODOs
 👉 Mark tasks as done ✅
👨‍💻 Built using: Node.js, Express.js, CORS, and JWT for secure authentication
